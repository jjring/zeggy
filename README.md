Zeggy is a bot that welcomes users to the I <3 Classic Rock room on Plug.dj and watches for AFK DJs. For a list of commands, please type '!commands'. If you have any issues or new ideas, please create a new issue/enhancement on the Zeggy github page.

The Chrome extension is used to load the javascript whenever navigating to a plug.dj page. This is especially useful since Zeggy is set to refresh the page every few hours. After the page refreshes, the script will automagically be loaded.

Please check out the room at http://plug.dj/i-3-classic-rock/ and check out our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/groups/i.love.classic.rock.too/
